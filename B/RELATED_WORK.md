# RELATED_WORK (to expand, 2023–2025)
This evolving note will track recent developments relevant to the NB/BD program and RH.

## Random Matrix Theory & Statistics of Zeros
- Keating–Snaith framework; Montgomery pair correlation; newer numerical surveys (2023–2025).
- Connections to quantum chaos and GUE conjecture (update with latest preprints).

## De Bruijn–Newman Constant
- Recent bounds and heuristics (insert up-to-date references).
- Heat-flow deformations and implications for RH.

## Numerical Zeta and High Zeros
- Large-scale computations of zeros on the critical line; verification windows; Turing's method updates.

## Constructive / Approximation-based Attempts
- Strengthened NB/BD criteria; Li/Keiper coefficients; reproducing kernel and Hardy-space angles.

> TODO: Populate with concrete citations once the bibliography is finalized.
