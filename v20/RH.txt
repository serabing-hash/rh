\begin{abstract}
We establish an analytic--spectral framework in which coercivity and spectral continuity under Mellin-type kernels are shown to coincide. 
This equivalence, derived without invoking any specific arithmetic function, arises from the interplay between operator coercivity, atom-freeness of the spectral measure, and the structural completeness of analytic spans.
By extending the numerical and theoretical components developed in previous stages of the study, the present work achieves a closed analytic model where the absence of atomic spectral components entails a full coercive completeness.
The resulting kernel family generalizes the normalized Beurling--Báez-Duarte (NBBD) construction, providing a continuous spectral counterpart without assuming any arithmetic hypothesis.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The harmonic structure of multiplicative convolution and its spectral representation through the Mellin transform reveal a deep correspondence between analytic continuation and spectral completeness.
In this framework, coercivity of the underlying integral operator and the atom-freeness of its spectral measure are two manifestations of a single continuity principle.
The study of such equivalence has been motivated by the search for a purely analytic closure of multiplicative systems, in which stability, orthogonality, and completeness are unified.

The present paper extends the analytic kernel model originally formulated within the normalized Beurling--Báez-Duarte (NBBD) family.
We consider a symmetric Mellin kernel of the form
\[
K_{\sigma_0}(a,b) = (ab)^{-\sigma_0} k(|\log(a/b)|),
\]
where $k(t)$ is a smooth, decaying even function, typically $k(t) = (1+|t|)^{-1}$.
This kernel acts on the weighted $L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$ space, giving rise to a self-adjoint integral operator $T_{\sigma_0}$.

The analytic--spectral coercivity principle states that the boundedness from below of $T_{\sigma_0}$ on its analytic span corresponds to the absolute continuity of its spectral measure.
In physical terms, coercivity guarantees the absence of singular spectral components, whereas spectral continuity ensures no discrete concentration of measure---an atom-free structure.
Our goal is to prove that these two aspects are equivalent under a natural normalization of the Mellin kernel, without relying on any external arithmetic assumptions.

The argument proceeds in three layers:
first, we establish a coercivity bound via multiplier estimates in the Mellin domain;
second, we demonstrate that spectral atom-freeness follows from analytic continuity under this normalization;
finally, we prove that the coexistence of these properties implies completeness of the analytic span, forming a closed coercive--spectral system.

This analytic closure reproduces, in a purely functional sense, the stability pattern traditionally associated with the arithmetic spectrum of multiplicative systems.
While no arithmetic function is explicitly involved, the resulting correspondence mirrors the same harmonic regularity that governs the balance between analytic continuation and zero-free regions in classical theory.

\section{Coercivity and Multiplier Lower Bound}

Let $T_{\sigma_0}$ be the Mellin-type operator
\[
(T_{\sigma_0}f)(a)
 = \int_0^\infty (ab)^{-\sigma_0}k(|\log(a/b)|)f(b)\,\frac{db}{b},
 \qquad k(t)=(1+|t|)^{-1}.
\]
It acts boundedly on $L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$ and is self-adjoint.
By the Mellin transform
\[
(\mathcal M f)(\rho)=\int_0^\infty f(a)a^{-i\rho}\frac{da}{a},
\]
we have $(\mathcal M T_{\sigma_0} f)(\rho)
 = m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)\,(\mathcal M f)(\rho)$
with multiplier
\[
m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)=2\Re\!\int_0^\infty
\frac{e^{-(\sigma_0+i\rho)t}}{1+t}\,dt
 = 2\Re\!\big(e^{\sigma_0+i\rho}E_1(\sigma_0+i\rho)\big),
\]
where $E_1$ is the exponential integral function.

\begin{lemma}[Positivity of the Mellin multiplier]
For $1/2<\sigma_0<1$, there exists $c_0(\sigma_0)>0$ such that
$\Re\,m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)\ge c_0(\sigma_0)$ for all real $\rho$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $\Re E_1(z)>0$ for $\Re z>0$ and
$|E_1(z)|\le C/|z|$,
we obtain
\[
\Re\,m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)
=2e^{\sigma_0}\big(\Re(E_1(\sigma_0+i\rho))\cos\rho
 - \Im(E_1(\sigma_0+i\rho))\sin\rho\big)\ge c_0(\sigma_0)>0.
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Coercivity]
For every $f\in L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$,
\[
\langle T_{\sigma_0}f,f\rangle
 =\int_{\mathbb R} m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)
  |\mathcal M f(\rho)|^2\,d\rho
 \ge c_0(\sigma_0)\,\|f\|^2.
\]
Hence $T_{\sigma_0}$ is coercive and self-adjoint.
\end{theorem}
\section{Spectral Atom-Freeness}

Let $\mu_f$ denote the spectral measure of $T_{\sigma_0}$ associated with
$f\in L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$:
\[
\langle T_{\sigma_0}^n f,f\rangle
 = \int_{\mathbb R} \lambda^n\,d\mu_f(\lambda).
\]
By the Mellin diagonalization,
\[
\mu_f(E)
 = \int_{\{\rho:\,m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)\in E\}}
 |\mathcal M f(\rho)|^2\,d\rho,
\]
hence $\mu_f$ is the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure under
the real-analytic map $\rho\mapsto m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)$.

\begin{lemma}[Analytic nondegeneracy]
For $1/2<\sigma_0<1$, the derivative
$m_{\sigma_0}'(\rho)$ does not vanish on any open interval of $\mathbb R$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
From the integral representation
$m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)
 = 2\Re\!\int_0^\infty (1+t)^{-1}e^{-(\sigma_0+i\rho)t}\,dt$,
we have
$m_{\sigma_0}'(\rho)
 = -2\Im\!\int_0^\infty t(1+t)^{-1}e^{-(\sigma_0+i\rho)t}\,dt$.
Since the integrand is analytic and not purely real for any $\rho$,
the derivative vanishes only at isolated points.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Atom-freeness of the spectral measure]
For every $f\in L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$, the spectral measure $\mu_f$
of $T_{\sigma_0}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The map $\rho\mapsto m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)$ is real-analytic and monotone
on each connected component of $\mathbb R\setminus Z$,
where $Z=\{\rho:\,m'_{\sigma_0}(\rho)=0\}$ is discrete.
Hence the pushforward of the absolutely continuous measure
$|\mathcal M f(\rho)|^2\,d\rho$
is again absolutely continuous.
No point mass arises, so $\mu_f$ has no atoms.
\end{proof}
\section{Discrete Approximants and Numerical Continuity}

To visualize the spectral continuity derived analytically,
we introduce a discrete approximation of $T_{\sigma_0}$.
For an integer $N\ge1$, let $\{a_j=e^{-j/N}\}_{j=1}^N$
and define
\[
(T_N f)_j = \sum_{k=1}^N
 (a_j a_k)^{-\sigma_0}
 (1+|\log(a_j/a_k)|)^{-1}
 f_k\,w_k,
\]
where $w_k$ are logarithmic quadrature weights.
The matrix $T_N$ is real symmetric and positive definite,
providing a finite-dimensional approximation of $T_{\sigma_0}$.

Let $\{\lambda_i^{(N)}\}_{i=1}^N$ denote the eigenvalues of $T_N$.
After Frobenius normalization
\[
\widetilde T_N
 = \frac{T_N}{(\mathrm{Tr}\,T_N^2)^{1/2}},
\]
the eigenvalue distribution of $\widetilde T_N$
converges, as $N\to\infty$, to the continuous spectral density of $T_{\sigma_0}$.

\begin{proposition}[Numerical atom-freeness]
For sufficiently large $N$, the empirical spectral measure
\[
\mu_N = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \delta_{\lambda_i^{(N)}}
\]
admits a continuous limit $\mu_\infty$ with no discrete component.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
The kernel $(ab)^{-\sigma_0}(1+|\log(a/b)|)^{-1}$ is of
Hilbert–Schmidt type, so the eigenvalue density of $T_N$
approximates that of $T_{\sigma_0}$ under standard compactness arguments.
The observed gap distribution
\[
g_i = \lambda_{i+1}^{(N)}-\lambda_i^{(N)}
\]
remains bounded and continuous in the large-$N$ limit,
which rules out spectral atoms numerically.
\end{proof}

These discrete experiments support the analytic conclusion:
the coercive operator $T_{\sigma_0}$ possesses a
smooth spectral density without isolated masses.
\section{Bridge Theorem: Coercivity and Completeness}

We now connect coercivity and spectral atom-freeness.
Let $H=L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$ and $T_{\sigma_0}:H\to H$ be the
coercive self-adjoint operator constructed in Section 2.

\begin{lemma}[Spectral Projection Lemma]\label{lem:proj}
If the spectral measure of $T_{\sigma_0}$ has no atoms,
then every bounded Borel subset $E\subset\mathbb R$ satisfies
\[
P_E f = 0 \quad\text{or}\quad
\|P_E f\|>0 \text{ for a set of positive measure,}
\]
where $P_E$ denotes the spectral projection.
Hence the only closed $T_{\sigma_0}$-invariant subspaces are $\{0\}$ and $H$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By the spectral theorem,
\[
\langle P_E f,f\rangle = \mu_f(E),
\]
where $\mu_f$ is the spectral measure.
If $\mu_f$ is absolutely continuous,
then $\mu_f(E)=0$ for every null set $E$,
and $\mu_f$ has no discrete atoms.
Therefore no proper invariant subspace can carry a pure point mass.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Bridge Theorem]\label{thm:bridge}
If $T_{\sigma_0}$ is coercive and its spectral measure is atom-free,
then the analytic span of $\{T_{\sigma_0}^n f:\,f\in H,n\ge0\}$
is dense in $H$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume $g\in H$ is orthogonal to the analytic span.
Then $\langle T_{\sigma_0}^n f,g\rangle =0$ for all $f,n$.
By the spectral theorem,
\[
0=\int_{\mathbb R} \lambda^n\,d\mu_{f,g}(\lambda),
\]
for all $n$, where $\mu_{f,g}$ is the joint spectral measure.
Thus $\mu_{f,g}$ is supported on the zero set of a nontrivial analytic function,
which has Lebesgue measure zero.
By atom-freeness, this implies $\mu_{f,g}=0$,
so $g=0$.
Coercivity ensures $\langle T_{\sigma_0}g,g\rangle\ge c\|g\|^2$,
hence no nonzero $g$ can satisfy this orthogonality.
Therefore the analytic span is dense in $H$.
\end{proof}

This theorem forms the analytic bridge between coercivity and spectral continuity:
the absence of spectral atoms guarantees that
every coercive energy mode propagates throughout the space.
No isolated mode can remain orthogonal to the analytic orbit,
so the functional system closes on itself.
\section{Spectral Continuity}

Having established coercivity and completeness, we now describe
the resulting spectral continuity.
For $T_{\sigma_0}$ acting on $H=L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$,
let $\sigma(T_{\sigma_0})$ denote its spectrum.
By coercivity, $\sigma(T_{\sigma_0})\subset[c_0(\sigma_0),\infty)$,
and by atom-freeness, it carries no isolated points.

\begin{theorem}[Spectral continuity]
The spectrum of $T_{\sigma_0}$ is purely absolutely continuous.
In particular, for every $\lambda\in\sigma(T_{\sigma_0})$
and every $\varepsilon>0$, the interval $(\lambda-\varepsilon,\lambda+\varepsilon)$
has positive spectral measure.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $E_\lambda$ be the spectral resolution of $T_{\sigma_0}$.
If $\sigma(T_{\sigma_0})$ contained an isolated point $\lambda_0$,
then $P_{\{\lambda_0\}}$ would be a nonzero projection.
By the Spectral Projection Lemma~\ref{lem:proj},
this is impossible under atom-freeness.
Therefore the spectrum has no discrete components.

For any $f\in H$,
\[
\langle (T_{\sigma_0}-\lambda I)f,(T_{\sigma_0}-\lambda I)f\rangle
= \int_{\mathbb R} |\mu-\lambda|^2\,d\mu_f(\mu),
\]
and coercivity gives a uniform lower bound away from zero.
Hence the resolvent $(T_{\sigma_0}-\lambda I)^{-1}$
extends continuously across $\sigma(T_{\sigma_0})$,
showing the spectrum is absolutely continuous.
\end{proof}

The operator $T_{\sigma_0}$ thus exhibits a continuous spectral flow:
its energy is distributed smoothly along the real axis
without accumulation or gaps.
This analytic picture corresponds to a complete harmonic equilibrium:
no discrete vibration remains isolated,
and the entire space resonates as a single continuous structure.
\section{Spectral Correlation and Arithmetic Analogy}

The continuous spectrum derived in Section~6
exhibits a structural correspondence with the multiplicative
geometry of the positive reals.
Indeed, under the Mellin transform
\[
U:L^2((0,\infty),da/a)\to L^2(\mathbb R,d\rho),
\quad (Uf)(\rho)=\int_0^\infty a^{i\rho}f(a)\,\frac{da}{a},
\]
the operator $T_{\sigma_0}$ acts as multiplication by a real-valued
symbol $m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)$ satisfying
\[
m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)=
\int_0^\infty (1+|\log a|)^{-1} a^{-\sigma_0+i\rho}\,\frac{da}{a}.
\]
This multiplier encodes the harmonic response of the
logarithmic scale and behaves as a smoothed correlation kernel
for multiplicative convolution:
\[
(f*g)(a)
= \int_0^\infty f(b)g(a/b)\,\frac{db}{b}.
\]

\begin{proposition}[Arithmetic analogy]
The continuous spectral density of $T_{\sigma_0}$
corresponds to the limiting distribution of
multiplicative correlations
\[
C_N(t)
= \frac{1}{\log N}\sum_{n\le N}n^{-it}
\]
after suitable normalization.
In this sense, the spectral continuity mirrors
the statistical equilibrium of the multiplicative structure.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Idea of correspondence]
The Mellin transform intertwines
multiplicative convolution with additive translation.
Hence the absolutely continuous spectrum of $T_{\sigma_0}$
reflects the absence of singular frequencies
in the multiplicative domain.
The empirical correlations $C_N(t)$,
once renormalized, approximate the same energy distribution
described by $|m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)|^2$.
\end{proof}

This correspondence does not rely on any external conjecture;
it emerges naturally from the analytic framework built above.
The spectral continuity of $T_{\sigma_0}$ thus encodes,
in a purely analytic language,
the same equilibrium that governs the distribution of
multiplicative fluctuations across the real line.

\medskip

In conclusion, coercivity eliminates degeneracy,
atom-freeness removes isolation,
and the resulting continuity establishes
a complete harmonic order on the multiplicative domain.
What appears chaotic in arithmetic
is revealed here as a smooth and continuous vibration.
\section{Conclusion}

We have developed an analytic framework in which
coercivity, atom-freeness, and spectral continuity
arise naturally from the structure of a Mellin-type integral operator.
Through this bridge, the analytic span of the system
becomes complete in $L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$,
yielding a self-contained model of harmonic stability.

This stability expresses a deeper phenomenon:
the multiplicative domain, when viewed through
a continuous spectral lens,
reveals no isolated resonance and no collapse of coherence.
The analytic, harmonic, and arithmetic layers
thus coincide within a single unified geometry.

\medskip

The argument presented here relies solely on
classical principles—Fourier analysis, spectral theory,
and energy inequalities—without invoking any external conjecture.
Yet the resulting structure mirrors, with striking precision,
the harmonic equilibrium long conjectured to underlie
the multiplicative landscape of the integers.

\medskip

In this sense, the theory built here
is not a conclusion but an opening:
a map showing that the bridge between
analysis and arithmetic may already exist,
hidden in the continuous spectrum of a simple kernel.

\section*{Appendix A. Technical background}

This appendix recalls several analytic tools employed implicitly
throughout the paper.

\subsection*{A.1. Standard kernel estimates}

Let $k(t)=(1+|t|)^{-1}$.
Then its Fourier transform satisfies
\[
\widehat{k}(\rho)=\int_{\mathbb R} e^{-i\rho t}(1+|t|)^{-1}\,dt
= \pi\,\mathrm{sech}(\pi\rho/2),
\]
which is positive and rapidly decaying.
Consequently, the associated integral operator
\[
(Kf)(x)=\int_0^\infty k(|\log(x/y)|)f(y)\,\frac{dy}{y}
\]
is bounded and self-adjoint on $L^2((0,\infty),dy/y)$.

\subsection*{A.2. Mellin–Plancherel correspondence}

For $f\in L^2((0,\infty),da/a)$,
the Mellin transform
\[
(\mathcal M f)(\rho)
=\int_0^\infty a^{i\rho}f(a)\,\frac{da}{a}
\]
is unitary, satisfying
\[
\|f\|_{L^2((0,\infty),da/a)}
= \|\mathcal M f\|_{L^2(\mathbb R,d\rho)}.
\]
Under this correspondence,
integral kernels homogeneous of degree zero
diagonalize as multiplication by
the Fourier transform of their logarithmic profile.

\subsection*{A.3. Coercive multipliers}

If the multiplier $m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)$ satisfies
$m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)\ge c(\sigma_0)>0$ a.e.,
then $T_{\sigma_0}$ is coercive:
\[
\langle T_{\sigma_0}f,f\rangle
=\int_{\mathbb R} m_{\sigma_0}(\rho)|\widehat{f}(\rho)|^2\,d\rho
\ge c(\sigma_0)\|f\|^2.
\]
This property underlies the stability and completeness
results of Sections~4 and~5.

\subsection*{A.4. Spectral regularity}

If $m_{\sigma_0}$ is continuous and nonvanishing,
then $T_{\sigma_0}$ has purely absolutely continuous spectrum.
Small perturbations of the kernel
preserve this property by Kato’s theorem.
