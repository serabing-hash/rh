# v19D_final — Atom-Free Completion toward RH (Spectral Continuity)

## Contents
- `v19D_final.tex` — Overleaf-compatible LaTeX (main manuscript + appendix hooks)
- `stable_code.py` — Frobenius-normalized NB/BD kernel pipeline (stub/artifact)
- `figure.png` — Placeholder figure (replace by running `stable_code.py`)

## Quick Start
1) Run:
   ```bash
   python stable_code.py
   ```
   This produces the three-panel figure and overwrites `figure.png`.
2) Compile `v19D_final.tex` (pdflatex or Overleaf).

## Notes
- Replace or merge `stable_code.py` with your finalized `v19D.2` implementation if you already have it.
- The LaTeX cites standard references; add your bibliography as needed.
