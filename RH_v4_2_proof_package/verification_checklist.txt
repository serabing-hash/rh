Verification Checklist (Reviewer-Friendly)
==========================================

A. Analytic Equivalence
1. Confirm the Mellin formulas for phi_theta and chi.
2. Check Theorem (Explicit Null Functional): kernel K_{B_{s0}} derivation from model space.
3. Verify "iff" structure: RH false <=> existence of nontrivial G with <chi,G> != 0 and <phi_theta, G> = 0 for all theta.

B. Unconditional Frame Bound
4. Inspect Toeplitz approximation lemma (K(u) ~ (1+u^2)^{-1}).
5. Validate discrete Hardy–Hilbert inequality and diagonal normalization.
6. Confirm lambda_min(A) >> 1/L^2 and hence E_N^2 << 1/log^2 N.

C. Constant Optimization
7. Re-derive c = 1/pi^2 using K(u)=1/(1+u^2) and its Fourier transform.
8. Check remainder R_ij = O(L^{-3}) and that it is negligible for L >= 5.

D. Numerical Reproduction
9. Run the public scripts on https://github.com/serabing-hash/rh up to N=10^4.
10. Fit slope on log–log plot; confirm ~ -2 and constancy of E_N^2 (log N)^2.
11. Compare with sweep_results_example.csv included in this package.

E. Build & Artifact Integrity
12. pdflatex + bibtex compile succeeds with TeX Live 2023+.
13. All references [Nyman 1950], [Báez-Duarte 2003], [Montgomery 1973], [Titchmarsh 1986] are present.
